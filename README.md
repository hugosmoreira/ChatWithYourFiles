Chroma Integration
Chroma is used for efficient indexing and retrieval of document content. It requires a setup for document processing and indexing.

Setting Up Chroma
Ensure you have Chroma installed and configured as per the project's requirements.
chroma.sqlite3 is used for data storage and indexing. This file should be generated during the first run of the application.
Excluding Chroma Database in Git
The chroma.sqlite3 file can be large and is excluded from the Git repository using .gitignore.
If you're setting up the project afresh, Chroma will create a new chroma.sqlite3 file.
